Start with the basics: know your broker and understand trading costs. Invest for the long-term rather than the short-term. If you are making money, stop using a strategy that is losing you money. Don\\'t fall in love with a particular strategy and stick to it when it\\'s not working. Don\\'t be afraid of losses – they can be very good for your financial education. Learn about trading psychology – how to stay calm during a difficult situation and maintain discipline. Don\\'t trade with your emotions! I mean, really. Never trade with your emotions! Trade with the fundamentals. Learn to walk, talk, think, read and analyze numbers, not emotions! Always check your positions before entering and exiting. Always have a \"buy\" order before every trade and \"sell\" order before every trade. Know when to cut a losing trade. Know when to stop losing. Know your risks, take them. A good starting point is 2x leverage for short term trades. There\\'s no reason for anyone to start out at zero. Never do a trading plan with too much complexity. And if you do, you\\'ll lose more often. For those new to options, let me clarify this one thing - selling an option is not a long-term strategy. You\\'re betting that a price drop is coming so you can sell the option when it happens, and you\\'ll sell at your loss. Buying puts or selling calls is also a short-term strategy. It\\'s a speculative trade, like short-term investing. It\\'s the exact opposite of investing and trading for the long-term. Trading puts or selling calls will not grow your wealth or your account value. It\\'s a way to lose money, fast and fun! Short selling a stock or ETF is not a good way to do it.']\n",

      "[\"Here are the 6 teams that I removed from your top 25, and here’s why:\\nOhio St dropped to #2: They’ve played only 5 games. There’s 11 remaining games. You can’t count the #1 team until they’re all in.\\nTennessee dropped from #7 to 22: They’ve been inconsistent on D. You can’t rely on a 22 point performance like they had on the first day of the playoffs.\\nLouisville dropped from #21 to 22: They’ve only beaten the teams you listed in your #2 team. Not so reliable in that one team and you can’t trust the #21 team for consistency.\\nBoise St dropped from 12 to 22: Their only big win was beating Baylor. You need a game like that to move up in your top 25 rankings.\\nIowa St dropped from #16 to 18: You can’t play 2 games against teams that only lost 1. They were 0-4 against a very strong schedule but not so bad in this schedule. They won’t move up.\\nBYU dropped from 9 to 19: 12 teams that had more than 2 wins have a bye. That puts BYU behind LSU. They won the game they needed, but then their record went back to 0-4, while they’re 0-4 in this game. 3 teams they beat didn’t have more than 1 win and had the loss of their only 2 game against another top 10 team and another game against a top 25 team that was undefeated. I believe that if the #13 team has an average of 45.0 points per game, there’s going to be only 1 team in the #25 slot, so you can’t count LSU. I wouldn’t count a 15 point win as 10 points. I didn’t count 27 points as 18 points.\\nYou had the team with the #18 team on a bye last week and the top 8. This week the #13 team had a bye and the top 6. And you counted the #13 team's 4 wins, when it could’ve been a 6 win season, since there was no loss. This means you count the top #3 team in 4 weeks, in 8 games and don’t count the team that went 7-1, in 10 games. You did this with Ohio St in the playoffs last week, in week 4, 5, 9 and 10.\\nHere are your final 2 weeks with 4 teams and 5 teams and 3 weeks with 8 teams and 10 teams, so it is still 20 teams for 4 weeks. And it is the only way you can possibly know what to do with the top #1 team that are 5 weeks away. Since I’m sure no one plays this 5-week schedule in their playoff game. I also put A&M last week with a bye on the week before the game with the #8 team that you put on bye last week. This week I put LSU on a bye when I put the #18 team with the #4 team on bye. You can’t rely on #20 team to beat #18. There are a couple more teams that could be on bye, but I didn’t count the 22 team since it’s so bad, that I put on bye in the playoffs with a team that beats 1-3 teams with no loss. I’m also using the team that has the most games left with a bye, when they also beat the #6 team without any loss. I also put #15 team and #21 team that won on #3 team without a loss on a bye last week. These games I have them on a bye again, and the #15 team still has a bye. If the teams don’t beat the teams I said they did last week without a loss. Then you can count them on a bye, but you can’t rely on them and the team on the bye last week. If I put a team on a bye last week and there’s a loss last week, then I count the bye and the game against #1 team since the #1 team won by a lot. Then I put another team that was beaten by the #1 team on a bye that beat the #1 team on the bye week. And then I put another team that was beaten on the bye that lost the loss game last week on a bye again. Since the #3 team only lost by 20. It doesn’t matter how many points the 5 teams lost by and they could’ve been 20, 27, 43, 50 and they could’ve won by more.\"]\n",

But I also believe you need to earn the right to believe you can have everything you desire and earn the right to expect success. I am not suggesting it is not okay to desire something that others are willing to give to you for free. But at least make an effort to not be lazy, not to cheat, or not to abuse people and manipulate them into doing the work for you. Not trying to steal something. You don’t have to deserve success and it can be given to you by the universe for no reason other than you are worthy, and not based on anything you’ve done to earn it. But success is not something that will be handed to you without you putting in the time and effort to do your job and work your butt off. But like you said, just don’t do the work and then wonder why you haven’t got success. You will end up stuck in that same miserable cycle where you wonder where it all went wrong. Success is not some magic word, but rather a reflection of your hard work and dedication. So if you think it will come to you just because you’re in a video game and you have the right level and a sword that lights up, I would advise to take the time to put in the effort and put the work in. Because, in the real world, hard work and dedication can bring you success and success can last a lifetime. And I'm sure you would rather be stuck in the digital world, not really making progress or achieving your goals. I just know the digital world is not the real world. And in the real world, people want people who have made it, not people who just want things for free. I don’t do that either, and if I wanted things for free, I would be a terrible employee and not a good role model for people in this digital world. I make money and I use my skills and I don’t beg for permission. I make it happen.\"]\n",

Driving should only be done by individuals who are sober and completely aware and able to handle a vehicle.

There has also been numerous studies that have proven that the use of cannabis in any manner will have adverse consequences. It is also a highly addictive drug and can also lead to substance use disorder. THC and cannabis contain a compound that interferes with short and long term memory, decision-making and other brain functions that impair judgment and reaction time, making it extremely dangerous while driving. The US Supreme Court has ruled that people using cannabis are impaired and should not be on the road. The dangers associated with recreational use of cannabis while operating a vehicle make it extremely dangerous, resulting in loss of life. If you want to ensure the safe use of your vehicle, avoid all forms of cannabis. This means abstaining from marijuana as well.
